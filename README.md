## Hello!

I'm currently building my portfolio page. I've planned some cool stuff for it but in the meantime, this readme should suffice. There are a few projects that could prove useful to you, kind vistor, so check them out when you can :P.

## My Projects

- ⚽️ **FIFA-AutoBidder**: If you're into FIFA, I've forked a popular auto-bidding/buying bot from FIFA 21 and tweaked a few things to make it work on FIFA 22.
 
- 📝 **Task-Organizer**: I've also made a Telegram bot that can help you organize and divide tasks amongst friends; it uses a Notion database as its database so it's easier to see and move stuff around, too.

- 📫 **Broadcast-Telegram**: If you have an important message you want to send to certain users/groups/channels on Telegram, I've got a bot (yes, another) for you; you can schedule messages to be sent at certain intervals, on certain days, etc.

- 🏟 **Soccer-Feed**: If you like following **soccer** (blasphemy!), I've got yet another Telegram bot that feeds you the latest on 13 competitions; it's still a work in progress but most of the skeleton is already laid out.

- 📈 **Options-Tracker**: Do you like losing money on the options market? If so, I have a handy (sigh) Telegram bot that helps you track options and pings you at certain thresholds; just enter any number of contracts in the appropriate format and it will send you an alert when each of them reach whatever threshold you set.

- 📺 **LiveChat-Alerts**: If you like to follow certain users in a YouTube livestream, I've got another Telegram bot for you; just type in their name and whatever they send in the live chat will be sent to you via the bot; I've built one for **Twitter** as well.

- 🛍 **Shopping-Telegram**: If you want to set up a store that works entirely on Telegram, I've got a pretty cool bot; with some customization, you should be able to use it to browse items, save items and retrieve them via a "barcode" system; users should be able to use coupon codes/referrals for discounts and you should be able to track their savings and referral payouts; I will work on this a little bit to ensure smooth integration with popular payment platforms.

- 🦠 **COVID-Stats**: If you want daily COVID stats, I've got a bot for that; you can get stats by country for now (all data from JHU).

## Collaboration

If you've got something cool in the works and need a semi-decent Python developer with okay frontend skills, feel free to reach out (Twitter is cool but anywhere else is fine, too).

### Some Python Packages I Use
- Django
- Python-Telegram-Bot
- Telethon
- Pandas
- Beautiful Soup
- Tensorflow (rudimentary)
- {Working with APIs, extracting & presenting data, unsure where to list this so I'll put it here for now}

### Stuff I'm Planning On Building
- 👨🏽 My Portfolio Page (hopefully using stuff that showcases my skills)

- 📰 Fantasy Premier League Analytics (something readily accessible on Telegram, maybe; should have most features of the offical app + some third-party apps)
    - In addition to the bot, a webpage that tracks the performance of users and delivers gameweek results in a special, tradeable card, sort of way

- 🗂 A Simple Resume Builder (with no ads, no subscriptions; will probably have several templates and other customization options)

- ♖ 3x3 Connect-Four-esque Game (feeding my nostalgia)

- 🤝 Projects with other folks

## Notes
I am writing up appropriate readmes for my projects and cleaning them up so people can clone them without worrying about getting lost or invading my privacy (so...many...API...keys...everywhere; environment variables ftw). I'll "unprivate" my repos as soon as I'm done :).
